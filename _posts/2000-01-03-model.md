<div style="text-align: justify">We design an encoder-decoder architecture that sequentially generates pairs of binary masks and categorical labels for each object in the image.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> Our model is composed of a series of recurrent modules (Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory - ConvLSTM) that are applied in chain with upsampling layers in between to predict a sequence of binary masks and associated class probabilities. Skip connections are incorporated in our model by concatenating the output of the corresponding convolutional layer in the base model (the one matching the current feature resolution) with the upsampled output of the ConvLSTM. Binary masks are finally obtained with a 1x1 convolution with sigmoid activation. </div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> We concatenate the side outputs of all ConvLSTM layers and apply a per-channel max-pooling operation to obtain a hidden representation that will serve as input to the two fully-connected layers that predict categorical labels and the stopping probabilities. </div>
