We present a recurrent model for semantic instance segmentation that sequentially generates pairs of masks and their associated class probabilities for every object in an image. Our proposed system is trainable end-to-end, does not require post-processing steps on its output and is conceptually simpler than current methods relying on object proposals. We observe that our model learns to follow a consistent pattern to generate object sequences, which correlates with the activations learned in the encoder part of our network. We achieve competitive results on three different instance segmentation benchmarks (Pascal VOC 2012, Cityscapes and CVPPP Plant Leaf Segmentation).
